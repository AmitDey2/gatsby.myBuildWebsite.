    Built in collaboration with CBRE’s Workplace team, 
    Spacer is a tool that helps companies learn how much office space they need, 
    and how to break up that space. By answering a short series of questions about their company’s unique goals 
    and priorities, users match with an office profile that summarizes their company’s characteristics. 
    This profile is the basis for a custom space program with square footage recommendations and a visualization of 
    every desk, office and conference room.
